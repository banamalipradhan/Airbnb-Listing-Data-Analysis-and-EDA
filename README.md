# Airbnb Listing Data Analysis & EDA

This project performs exploratory data analysis on Airbnb listings to understand pricing behavior, neighbourhood trends, room type distribution, customer engagement, and listing availability. The goal is to provide meaningful insights that can support hosts in pricing strategies and help customers make informed booking decisions.

## Problem Statement

Airbnb pricing varies heavily across neighbourhoods, listing categories, and host attributes. Without proper analysis, hosts may underprice and lose revenue, while customers may overpay for similar listings.  
This project focuses on exploring Airbnb listing data to identify the key factors influencing price and demand.

## Objectives

- Analyze listing distribution across neighbourhoods and room types
- Understand price variations and cost-driving factors
- Study review patterns as indicators of listing popularity
- Examine yearly availability trends for booking behavior
- Derive actionable insights for hosts and travelers

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes:

- Price per night
- Room Type (Entire home/apartment, Private room, Shared room)
- Neighbourhood and location-based details
- Number of reviews per listing
- Host listing count (experience measure)
- Availability throughout the year

Minor missing values and outliers were handled during preprocessing.

## Approach

1. Loaded dataset and verified data quality
2. Removed irrelevant or duplicate information
3. Conducted descriptive analysis and distribution checks
4. Visualized:
   - Price vs Neighbourhood
   - Room-type price differences
   - Reviews vs listing popularity
   - Availability trends across listings
5. Summarized key findings for decision support

## Key Insights

- Entire homes are priced significantly higher than private/shared rooms
- Certain neighbourhoods show strong demand and higher pricing
- Listings with more reviews are generally more trusted and frequently booked
- Some properties remain underutilized due to low availability or low visibility

These findings can be used to optimize listing visibility and pricing strategy.
